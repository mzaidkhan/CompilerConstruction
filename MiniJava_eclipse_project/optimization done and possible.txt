optimization:

-remove nop's
(-remove store,load ops if same value was already on stack)
-inline methods if they return a literal

Done:
-if then else is optimized
-constant expressions
-while statements (while false is removed)
-constant identifiers
-reduce method to "return const" if expression is constant, only in case when there is no method call or print statement
-peephole for multiplication (replaced with shiftLeft if possible)
